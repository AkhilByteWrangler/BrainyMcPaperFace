import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
// First things first: import React and ReactDOM. React is the cool framework we're using, and ReactDOM is here to help us render stuff in the browser.
// It's like having the brain (React) and the muscles (ReactDOM) working together to bring your app to life.

import './index.css'; 
// We’re importing our global CSS file here. It's where we give our app some basic styling so it doesn’t look like a 90s Geocities site.

import App from './App'; 
// Importing the star of the show: our App component. This is the main piece of our React app, and everything else is basically a side character in comparison.

ReactDOM.render(
  // Time to tell ReactDOM to do its thing and actually show our app in the browser. Without this, all our React components are just theoretical ideas floating in the void.

  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  // React.StrictMode is like a friendly but firm teacher. It helps catch potential issues in your code and warns you when you're doing something risky, 
  // like using deprecated features or forgetting best practices. It's like a helpful sidekick that tells you to clean your room before the guests arrive.

  document.getElementById('root')
  // Here’s the magic part: "root" is where all your React components will live in the DOM. It’s like we’re building a treehouse and "root" is the sturdy tree we're hanging everything on.
